# IMDB Movie recommendation Project

Please read through jupyter notebook that explains the step by step methods how I implemented this project.

I have written a blog to explain my approach towards same - https://neerajsomani.medium.com/imdb-movie-recommendation-project-cf04ccdc0463

IMDB (Internet Movie Database) is an amazon company and it has one of the biggest dataset when its comes down to audio-video entertainment content, either it be Movies, TvSeries, or short films or documentaries.

A few days back I came to know about this CloudGuruChallenge that publish in October 2020. The goal of the project is to use any technology tools to analyze data and make some recommendation predictions, like course recommendation or movie recommendation or song recommendation, etc.

Goal: Build a movie Recommendation Engine
Tools and Technology used: Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and SciKit Learn. (Side note, as you can see the original challenge is to use ML technologies on AWS or cloud platform, but we are using these basic tools for now and move up in next article to connect and use cloud technologies)

High level steps that we are going to follow:
- Define Problem statement — (Understanding the basics of problem that you want to solve. Breakdown your problem into small problems).
- Data Extraction / collection — (Collect any amount of supporting Data).
- Analyze and Visualize Data Patterns — (This helps in understanding the Data that you collected)
- Data Transformation — (Data Cleaning, Data Filtering, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, and many more)
- Save / Load Data — (Save your transformed data for Machine Learning models)
- Apply Machine Learning Models — (verify your results, predict and solve problems)
- Presentation — (Build a Dashboard or report that can showcase the solution for the problem)
